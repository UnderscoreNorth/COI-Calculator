# COI-Calculator

Very creatively named, for the game [`Captain of Industry`](https://www.captain-of-industry.com/).

## How to Use

Should just pull package, install packages, and "npm run dev" to get going.
src/lib/calc.ts is the logic, and src/lib/data contains all the info for recipes and items and shit
